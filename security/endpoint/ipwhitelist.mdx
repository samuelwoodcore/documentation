This endpoint is responsible for whitelisting an IP address which is to be attached to a particular API KEY. This adds an extra layer of security by ensuring that API calls can only be made from approved IP addresses.

<Note>
  The IP address must be approved using the OTP sent to the user's email address before it becomes active.
