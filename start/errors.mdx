* **01 Passed Request:** 
    * This means the request was either passed `200` or accepted `202`
* **0 Failed Request:** 
    * This means the request failed and the reasosn will be returned. This usually has a `404` `400` `403` HTTP response code
* **500 Internal Server Error:** 
    * An unexpected error occurred on the server side. This may be due to a bug, temporary system issue, or other unforeseen circumstances.

## Error Responses

When an error occurs, the API will typically return a JSON response with the following structure:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Passed">
```json
{
    "status": "01",
    "message": "Success",
    "data": {}
}
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Failed">
```json
{
    "status": "0",
    "message": "failed",
    "data": {}
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Internal Error">
```json
{
    "status": "500",
    "message": "failed",
    "data": {}
}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Error Handling

    **Client-Side**:
        Check the HTTP status code of the response.
        If the status code indicates an error, parse the JSON response to extract the error details.
        Display an appropriate error message to the user.
        Implement retry logic for transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary server errors) if necessary.

    **Server-Side**:
        Implement proper error logging to help diagnose and fix issues.
        Use a consistent error handling mechanism throughout the API.
        Consider using a centralized error handling library or framework.

#### Best Practices

    Provide clear and informative error messages.
    Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
    Document all possible error codes and their corresponding messages.
    Test error handling thoroughly.

This document provides a general overview of API errors and their handling. Specific error handling mechanisms and responses may vary depending on the individual API endpoints and their functionality.

Note: This is a basic template, and you may need to adjust it based on the specific needs and complexity of your API.
