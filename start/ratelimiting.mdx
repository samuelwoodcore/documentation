# API Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is a crucial mechanism used by APIs to control the number of requests that a client can make within a specific time period. It helps prevent abuse, ensures fair usage, and maintains the performance of the API for all users.

This guide will explain what rate limiting is, how it works, and how you can handle rate limits effectively in your applications.

## What is Rate Limiting?

Rate limiting is the practice of restricting the number of API requests a client can make in a given time frame. It is implemented to protect the API from being overwhelmed by too many requests in a short period, ensuring that the server remains responsive for all users.

Common rate limiting strategies include:

- **Fixed Window**: A fixed time period (e.g., 1 minute) during which a set number of requests are allowed.
- **Sliding Window**: A more dynamic approach where the time period "slides" with each request, limiting the number of requests within a given window.
- **Leaky Bucket**: Requests are allowed at a steady rate, and excess requests are discarded.
- **Token Bucket**: Requests are granted as long as tokens are available in the bucket, and tokens refill at a constant rate.

## Rate Limiting Header Information

When an API request is rate-limited, the response will usually include headers indicating the status of the rate limit. These headers provide important information about the limits and your current usage.

### Common Rate Limiting Headers

- `X-Rate-Limit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests that can be made in a given time period (e.g., 1000 requests per hour).
- `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current time window.
- `X-Rate-Limit-Reset`: The time at which the rate limit will reset, typically expressed in Unix epoch time (seconds).
- `Retry-After`: The time (in seconds) that you need to wait before sending a new request after hitting the rate limit.

Example response headers:

```http
X-Rate-Limit-Limit: 1000
X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: 990
X-Rate-Limit-Reset: 1611172800
Retry-After: 30
