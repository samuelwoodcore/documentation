Our API provides two distinct environments for integration: **Sandbox** and **Live**. Each environment serves a unique purpose and has specific requirements for access and usage. However, both environments have similar behaviour but with different security covrage. Stay with me...

The **Sandbox** environment is designed for testing and development. It allows you to simulate API requests and responses without affecting real-world data. Worry not becasue you will have the exact same experince on the production environment.

### Base URLs
- **Sandbox Environment**:  `https://spark.test.woodcore.co/api/v2`
- **Production Environment**:  `https://api.woodcore.co/api/v2`

<Note>
 We encourage you to change your base URL from `woodcoreapp.com` if you still have it in use to `woodcore.co`. The `woodcoreapp.com` will be depreciated soon.
</Note>

### Live (Production) Environment

The Live environment is used for production purposes, where all operations process real-world data. This environment requires strict security measures to ensure data integrity and compliance. Below are some things to take note of before requesting for a go-live access on Woodcore.

- Every API Request must come from the whitelisted IP
- Based on request, your API can be wrapped into a VPN, this means you have to establish a site to site vpn connection with Woodcore to get it working `depreciated feature`
- Every request you make has a TLS Encryption
