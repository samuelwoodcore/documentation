## January, 2025

#### Balance Calulation Update
Deposit account balance will not longer be calculted real-time on the system, when a transaction is completed the balance will remain the same way until either the following happens;
- Balance will get updated after **30 mins**
- Pass `refresh` as `true` to the `/savingsaccounts/{savingsId}` endpoint as a query param. see example below

```curl
curl -X GET "https://base.com/savingsaccounts/{savingsId}?refresh=true" -H "Accept: application/json"
```
<Note>
  If `refresh` is not set as `true` the current balance as is will be returned
